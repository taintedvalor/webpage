<div style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Section 1: Claims</strong></div>

<p><em>Claims are a crucial aspect of our server, and it's important to follow these rules to maintain a positive and fair environment.</em></p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.1 Griefing and Exploitation</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>No griefing or intentionally harming another player's build.</li>
    <li>Exploiting claim mechanics, such as using chisels to bypass protections, is strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Penalties for Violation:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the severity of your actions, violations may result in warnings, punishments, or even bans.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.2 Reporting Griefing</strong></div>

<p>If you're a victim of griefing:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>First, take screenshots and document the incident, including the offender's details if possible.</li>
    <li>If the griefing occurs outside your claim, you can remove the objects yourself if feasible. If it's too extensive, contact an admin.</li>
    <li>Before taking any action, contact an admin directly or create a ticket. We encourage using the ticket system.</li>
    <li>Admins will review your evidence, remove the obstructing structures, and take appropriate action against the offender.</li>
</ol>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.3 Retribution Option</strong></div>

<p>If you're griefed but choose not to seek retribution:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Contact an admin and provide evidence of the incident.</li>
    <li>Admins will handle the situation. You may take limited actions like creating annoying structures or placing signs, but refrain from aggressive behavior.</li>
</ol>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.4 Etiquette and Dispute Resolution</strong></div>

<p>In any situation involving claims and player disputes:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Maintain common etiquette and respect for others.</li>
    <li>If you encounter issues with other players and claims, submit a ticket with your evidence.</li>
    <li>Our moderators and administrators will respond promptly to resolve the matter.</li>
</ol>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.5 Claiming Unclaimed Work and Proper Etiquette</strong></div>

<p>Respecting others' efforts and creations is paramount to our server's community spirit. It's important to understand that just because a structure or land is unclaimed, it doesn't grant you the right to claim it as your own due to oversight or inactivity. Here are the guidelines regarding claiming unclaimed work:</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.6 Respect Unclaimed Work</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 60px;">
    <li>Unclaimed builds, lands, or resources should be treated with respect. It's not acceptable to claim them solely because they are unclaimed.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.7 Proper Etiquette</strong></div>

<p>If you come across unclaimed work that you wish to use or modify, here's the proper etiquette to follow:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 60px;">
   <li>Contact the original builder or creator if possible, and inquire about their intentions.</li>
   <li>If you receive no response within a reasonable time, respect their work but don't automatically claim it as your own.</li>
</ol>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.8 Document Ownership</strong></div>

<p>If you are the original builder or creator of a structure or land but have forgotten to claim it, document your ownership through signs, markers, or communication with fellow players or admins.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.9 Admin Intervention</strong></div>

<p>If a dispute arises over unclaimed work, admins will intervene to determine the rightful ownership. Proof of original creation may be requested.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.10 Unclaimed Resources</strong></div>

<p>Unclaimed resource nodes or farms should be used responsibly and not over-harvested. If you discover a resource area that seems forgotten, consider notifying the community or the player who may have overlooked it.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.11 Promoting Fairness</strong></div>

<p>Our goal is to foster a community where fairness and respect for others' work prevail. Claiming unclaimed work without proper communication or reason goes against this spirit.</p>


<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>1.12 Requesting Bonus Claims for Larger Builds</strong></div>

<p>We understand that larger projects and builds can require more space and resources. To accommodate these cases, we offer the option to request bonus claims for builds that exceed the standard size limit, with the maximum being 35 chunks. However, these requests will be considered exceptionally and must adhere to specific guidelines:</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.13 Requesting Bonus Claims</strong></div>

<p>If you wish to request bonus claims for a larger build, follow these steps:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 60px;">
   <li>Create a detailed ticket in our Discord server.</li>
   <li>In your ticket, provide the following:
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 60px;">
         <li>Screenshots of your build to illustrate its size and complexity.</li>
         <li>A clear explanation of your reasoning for needing bonus chunks.</li>
         <li>Examples on the built-in world map or Dyno map to show where your build is located.</li>
         <li>Your exact in-game Minecraft username.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.14 Case-by-Case Review</strong></div>

<p>All bonus claim requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The circumstances surrounding individual claims, especially those nearby, will also be considered in the evaluation.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.15 Interference with Others' Claims</strong></div>

<p>It's important to note that bonus claims will likely be denied if they interfere with someone else's claim without their explicit agreement. Respect for other players' territory is a key principle of our server.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>1.16 Rare Exceptions</strong></div>

<p>While the maximum bonus claim limit is 100 chunks, further exceptions beyond this limit will be made very rarely and only in extraordinary cases. Such exceptions will undergo a rigorous review process.</p>

<div style="font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Section 2: Individual Agreements</strong></div>

<p><em>While most agreements on the server are straightforward and positive, it's essential to address situations where agreements are not upheld. This includes tasks, assistance, item exchanges, or any other commitments. If you find yourself in such a situation, here are the rules regarding individual agreements:</em></p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.1 Agreement Fulfillment</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>When you agree to do a task, help someone, provide an object, or commit to any form of arrangement, it's expected that you keep your end of the deal.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.2 Request for Compensation</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>If you believe that you have fulfilled your part of the agreement, and a significant amount of effort was invested, but the other party has not reciprocated as agreed, you have the right to request fair compensation.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.3 Admin Intervention</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>In cases where agreements are not upheld and you believe you deserve compensation, you can initiate the following steps:</li>
    <li>Create a ticket explaining the situation in detail, including evidence if available.</li>
    <li>The severity and context of the situation will be carefully evaluated by the server administrators.</li>
    <li>Admins will mediate and, if necessary, facilitate a conversation between the involved parties to find a resolution.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.4 Resolution and Reparation</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The outcome of admin intervention will depend on the specific circumstances. Reparation may include item exchanges, task completion, or other fair compensation as deemed appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.5 Fairness and Context</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Admins will consider the fairness of the situation and take into account the context surrounding the agreement when determining a resolution.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>2.6 Confidentiality</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>All discussions related to individual agreements and admin interventions will be handled with discretion and kept confidential among the involved parties and server administrators.</li>

<p><em>To ensure a smooth experience on our private Minecraft server, it's essential for all players to have a good understanding of the mod pack and its individual mechanics. Additionally, it's courteous to stay updated by following announcements in our Discord server.</em></p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.1 Mod Pack Familiarity</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>While the server is currently open without a whitelist, we expect all players to familiarize themselves with the inner workings of the mod pack to a reasonable extent. This understanding helps you solve common issues independently.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.2 Automodpack Awareness</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The Automodpack is a crucial component of our mod pack, but it can occasionally pose challenges. Understanding how it works is vital for your gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.3 Common Troubleshooting</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>If you encounter issues related to the mod pack, especially regarding the Automodpack, consider these common troubleshooting steps:</li>
    <li>Open the main directory of your mod pack instance.</li>
    <li>Search for the Automodpack folder and ensure it is not the mod itself.</li>
    <li>If found, delete the Automodpack folder.</li>
    <li>The folder will regenerate itself upon the next launch, often resolving issues.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.4 Potential Issue - Launch Problems</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The primary issue that may arise from the Automodpack is the inability to launch your Minecraft instance. Following the steps mentioned above can typically resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.5 Server Whitelist Future Change</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Please be aware that the server's open status may change in the future, and a whitelist will be introduced. Detailed explanations regarding this change will be provided at each entry point to the server.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>3.6 Stay Updated</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>To stay informed about server updates, mod pack changes, and important announcements, it's courteous to actively follow the announcements in our Discord server.</li>
</ul>

<p>By adhering to these guidelines, you'll contribute to a smoother and more enjoyable experience for yourself and all other players on our Minecraft server. Your understanding of the mod pack and responsiveness to updates will help maintain a positive gaming environment.</p>

<p><em>Our server operates on a seasonal basis, with each season indicated in the bottom left corner of your mod pack. Seasons typically last for 3 to 4 months, although the duration may vary based on expectations and needs. Here are the rules and guidelines regarding seasons and world resets:</em></p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.1 Seasonal Changes</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>The server operates on a seasonal cycle, with each season denoted by a number in your mod pack's interface, located above the Minecraft version and beside the modpack version. Currently, we are in Season 1.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.2 World Reset and Modifications</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>At the end of each season, a world reset will occur. This reset is essential for several reasons:</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>It helps address issues, bugs, or imbalances that may have arisen during the season.</li>
        <li>It allows us to introduce necessary mod updates and changes.</li>
        <li>It provides an opportunity to append or modify server rules as needed to enhance the gameplay experience.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.3 Server Announcement</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Prior to the start of a new season and the world reset, an announcement will be made through our Discord server and other relevant communication channels. This announcement will include important details, such as the date of the reset, any mod changes, and any updated rules.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.5 Adherence to New Rules</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>With each season, there may be changes or additions to the server's rules. It's crucial for all players to familiarize themselves with these updated rules and adhere to them.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.6 Seasonal Progression</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>Embrace the seasonal progression as an opportunity for a fresh start and new adventures. It's a chance to explore different aspects of the mod pack and engage with fellow players in novel ways.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 20px;"><strong>4.7 Feedback and Suggestions</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 40px;">

<p>PvP is allowed on our modded Minecraft server, but it's essential to maintain fairness and respect. Here are the rules and etiquette for PvP:</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.1 Claims Protection</strong></div>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 60px;">
    <li>In your own claim, you are protected from other players' attacks. This ensures the safety of your property. However, players outside your party do not enjoy this protection.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.2 Self-Defense in Claims</strong></div>

<p>If someone within your claim harasses you, breaks rules, or damages your property, you can defend yourself.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.3 PvP Etiquette in Claims</strong></div>

<p>In a PvP situation within your claim:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 60px;">
   <li>You can defend yourself.</li>
   <li>If you win the fight, place the aggressor's grave (a modded item) outside of your claim. This allows them to retrieve their items without conflict.</li>
</ul>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.4 Starting Fights in The Wilds</strong></div>

<p>When initiating a PvP fight in The Wilds (any unclaimed area), you can't claim the aggressor's items as a result of the battle. This prevents unnecessary conflicts.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.5 Retrieving Graves in The Wilds</strong></div>

<p>If you're attacked in The Wilds and successfully defend yourself, you're allowed to take the aggressor's grave as compensation for their actions.</p>

<div style="font-size: 16px; margin-left: 40px;"><strong>7.6 Dispute Resolution</strong></div>

<p>If any disputes or conflicts arise from PvP actions or grave retrieval, please create a ticket and provide evidence. Our staff will review and mediate to ensure fairness.</p>

<p>These PvP guidelines aim to balance self-defense within claims while discouraging conflicts in unclaimed areas (The Wilds). We promote a respectful and fair gaming environment, where disputes are resolved through evidence-based mediation.</p>
